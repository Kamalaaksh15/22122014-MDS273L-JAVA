Create a java program, that stores the details of a student (Name, Register Number, Email, Class, Department).
You can use a two-dimensional array to store the details.
HINT: String arr[] = {{"Alwin",1847207,"alwin@christ.in","MCA","Computer Science"},{"Balagangadhar",2011204,"bala@christ.in","MDS","Data Science"}}

You need to have functions to:
Collect the details of the student
Display the details of the student
With the help of a menu-driven main function, you need to access these functions inside your class and perform the operations.

Whenever you are entering the details of a student, you need to enter the value into a static global string array, that stores the names that the user has entered. Searching this array will help you to find, if the details of the student are already entered into the program.
